This Python program evaluates the strength of a password by checking if it meets certain criteria and provides feedback based on these checks:

    Length Check: The password must be at least 8 characters long. If it meets this criterion, it increases the strength score by 1.
     If not, a feedback message is added to indicate the requirement.

    Uppercase Letter Check: The program looks for at least one uppercase letter in the password using a regular expression. 
     If found, it increases the strength score by 1. Otherwise, a feedback message is added.

    Lowercase Letter Check: Similarly, the program checks for at least one lowercase letter and adjusts the strength score accordingly.

    Digit Check: The program checks for the presence of at least one digit in the password. If present, it increments the strength score by 1.

    Special Character Check: The program looks for special characters (e.g., @, $, !, %, *, ?, &, #) in the password. If found, it increases the strength score by 1.

    Strength Assessment: Based on the accumulated strength score (ranging from 0 to 5), the program provides feedback:
        A score of 5 indicates a strong password.
        A score of 3 or 4 indicates a moderate password.
        A score below 3 indicates a weak password.

The program provides specific feedback messages to guide users on how to improve their passwords to meet the strength criteria.
